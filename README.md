# Creahana countries
This project was made to Crehana Frontend Test 


# Stack
I used the requested base Stack with various additional frameworks just to give evidence of the knowledge I have. 

## NextJs
I used NextJs to add a server-side rendering layer which provides SEO benefits.

## Sass
I used this tool to boost css

## Apollo-Client
I implemented Apollo-Client for interaction with Graphql. To get the most benefit from TypeScript I used Graphql-codegen with which I can have all the types of my queries

##  Testing-Library
For the implementation of tests I used the testing-library framework which optimizes good practices and provides an environment closer to the interaction of a real user.


## Linters
I used eslint and prettier in order to establish rules in the code syntax

##  Commitlint
Most projects are developed in teams, which is why I find it convenient to use this tool for commit verification.

### Aditional features
* Incremental Site Generation
* Path aliases
* Open graph
